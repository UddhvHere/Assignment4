The program opens and reads a text file named "sample.txt" and prints its content line by line while handling errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

# Write and Append Data to a File (Task 2)
The program takes user input and writes it to a file named "output.txt" after which it appends additional data to the same file and in the end it reads and displays the final content of the file.
